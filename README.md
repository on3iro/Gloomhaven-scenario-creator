## About
__As of 12.02.2017 this project is still in very early development and does not yet
take any contributions!__

The Gloomhaven-scenario-creator is a web editor for scenarios, campaigns and assets for the
[Gloomhaven Board Game](http://www.cephalofair.com/gloomhaven) by Isaac Childres, which has been released
in early 2017. The *GSC* should make it easy to develop new content for the game and encourage people to do so.

This App is 100% unofficial and in no way related to Isaac Childres. I am currently trying to contact Isaac, though.
To get his approval for this app, because it will make heavy use of the games asset imagery.
I also plan to keep this app free and open source forever.

This web frontend is based on [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) + [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
and should be used in conjunction with a [Backend-API](https://github.com/on3iro/Gloomhaven-SC-backend).

## Roadmap
The following roadmap should highlight some development milestones and goals from top to bottom.
As certain features are going to be implemented, sub goals might appear.
Also priority of certain goals might change in the future, depending on user feedback.
There is currently no specific timeframe for each individual goal, because I am very busy right now and
because I still have no confirmation of approval for the project from Isaac Childres as of yet.
