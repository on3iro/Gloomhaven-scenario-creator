## About
__As of 12.02.2017 this project is still in very early development and does not yet
take any contributions!__

The Gloomhaven-scenario-creator is a web editor for scenarios, campaigns and assets for the
[Gloomhaven Board Game](http://www.cephalofair.com/gloomhaven) by Isaac Childres, which has been released
in early 2017. The *GSC* should make it easy to develop new content for the game and encourage people to do so.

This App is 100% unofficial and in no way related to Isaac Childres. I am currently trying to contact Isaac, though.
To get his approval for this app, because it will make heavy use of the games asset imagery.
I also plan to keep this app free and open source forever.

This web frontend is based on [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) + [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
and should be used in conjunction with a [Backend-API](https://github.com/on3iro/Gloomhaven-SC-backend).

## Contribution
I am still developing the project baseline and therefore am not yet taking any contributions.
Eventually I will, though!
